# AGERO-GraphDatabaseDemo

Demo project for graph databases.

## Requirements
* .Net 4.7
* An installed Neo4j database

## Neo4j database

For demo usage the easiest way is probably to click the default Download button on: https://neo4j.com/download/
That will install the **"Neo4j Server Enterprise Edition for Developers"** and the **"Neo4j Desktop"** which is a convenient tool to 
interact with your databases (like Sql Management Studio for SQL Server).

Create a database, and set password to "agero" (which is set in the config file in the example project).

## Swagger

To test the api via swagger
* run the solution, with the Agero.GraphDatabaseDemo project as startup
* goto url http://localhost:49810/swagger/
